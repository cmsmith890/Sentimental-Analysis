# Sentimental-Analysis
Code Louisville Project - Data Analysis 1 Tuesday

For this project, I decided to create a program that can track positive, negative or neutral reviews using a database from IMdb. This database contains an exhaustive list of movies and keywords that detemine whether or not the review was positive, negative or neutral.Included withing the repository is a CSV containing the database, as well as two different text files with texts in both files. This project was meant to use sentiment analysis and NLP.
